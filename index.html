<h2> Introduction into my journey</h2>

<p> This a small introduction into who I am and why I decided to take an interest in the world of Software development
<h2>There is no future without a past!</h2>

<p> I grew up knowing that family is everything, because it is all I had. Whether good times or bad, the ones that will be there is family. I have so many that have affected me over the years that I can't help but be humble. I would love to cover every one on this page but no one would have the time and patience to read it al ha!ha! ha!Maybe once I become a little better I will consider that as an option but for now I will stick to my core reasons for doing what I do. Please feel free to visit some of the other links and learn about what keeps me happy! </p>
